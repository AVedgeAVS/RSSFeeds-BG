<title> ****** Current version 20.3.3. | 3-March-2020: We've fixed the YouTube error. You can now go back to viewing your music videos and other YouTube content | If you tried PLEX Movies and TV Shows yet, check it out. There’s lots of movies and TV shows to stream. Please note, the PLEX account is shared with other AV Edge BG and HUB users. | We’ve moved the APPS menu to the submenu of SYSTEM. So, you can still find all the loaded video addons in the SETTINGS  submenu. | Enjoy the new AV Edge BG update! | {{Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SETTINGS then scroll down to Services and click on it. The version is listed in Device name.| Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie or TV show, try pausing for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play.}} </title>
