<title> ****** Current version 19.7.28. | 28-July-2019: There's a nnew version of AV Edge HUB BG build. This exciting new build from AV Edge is designed to give you faster streaming and an easier to use interface with bright and colourful backgrounds for a stimulating user experience. AV Edge BG includes all the usual content you get with the HUB, and we will be adding even more exciting content in the weeks to come. We made some fixes to Fluxus Lust 18+ and Karaoke in the MUSIC section. Plus we removed several Addons that no longer work.| {{Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SETTINGS then scroll down to Services and click on it. The version is listed in Device name. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie or TV show, try pausing for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play.}} </title>
