<title> ****** New version 20.12.8. | 10-Dec-2020: There is a new version of the AV Edge BG build. |  We added documentaries, CBC TV shows, US news channels, and a health and fitness section | We've removed the KIDS menu and cleaned up add-ons that no longer work. | We've also added new Adult add-ons. | And there are lots of movies and TV shows to stream PLEX. The PLEX account is shared with other AV Edge users. | Enjoy the new AV Edge BG update! | {{Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SETTINGS then scroll down to Services and click on it. The version is listed in Device name.| Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie or TV show, try pausing for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play.}} </title>
